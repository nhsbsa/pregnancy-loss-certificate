    <div class="govuk-inset-text">You'll need to contact the other parent to let them know that you'd like to add their name to the certificate.</div>

    <p>We’ll ask you for the other parent’s date of birth. This is because we need to match their details with their GP record, if they give permission for their name to be on the certificate.</p>

    <div class="govuk-warning-text">
      <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
      <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
        <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
        If the date of birth you enter for the other parent does not match the date they enter, your request for a certificate will be cancelled.
      </strong>
    </div>

    <p>We’ll ask you for the other parent’s email address so we can send them a link. They’ll be asked to:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>give permission to be named on the certificate</li>
      <li>confirm their details</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your request may take up to 21 days if you add the other parent's name to the certificate. This is because the other parent will have up to 7 days to give permission before the request is complete.</p>

    <p>If we get their permission, you'll then receive the certificate within 14 days.</p>

    <div class="govuk-warning-text">
      <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
      <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
        <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
        If the other parent chooses not to be named on the certificate, your request will be cancelled.
      </strong>
    </div>

    <p>You'll be able to start again and request a certificate that shows only your name as a parent of your baby.</p>
