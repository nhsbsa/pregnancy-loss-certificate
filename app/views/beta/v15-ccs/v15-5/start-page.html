     Request a baby loss certificate
    </h1>
    <p>
      If your pregnancy ends before 24 weeks, you can get a certificate in memory of your baby.  It’s free to get a certificate.</p>
    <p>You do not need to request a certificate if you prefer not to. It’s optional.</p>
    
    <div class="govuk-inset-text">The certificate is not a legal document. For example, you cannot use it to claim benefits. The certificate will not be added to your GP record.</div>

    <p>If your pregnancy ends from 24 weeks onwards, you need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-stillbirth">register a stillbirth</a> instead.</p>

   

 
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
    
    <p>You'll need:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>your NHS number or postcode registered with your GP</li>
      <li>access to your mobile phone or email address registered with your GP</li>
      <li>permission from the other parent and their email address if you also want their name on the certificate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/find-nhs-number/">find out your NHS number on the NHS website</a>.</p>
        
    
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Request a certificate
    </h2>
    <p>You can ask for a certificate if all these apply:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>you’ve lost a baby before the 24th week of pregnancy</li>
      <li>you’re one of the baby’s parents or surrogate</li>
      <li>you’re at least 16 years old</li>  
      <li>your pregnancy ended on or after 1 September 2018</li>
      <li>you lived in England when you lost your baby</li>
      <li>you live in England</li>
      
    </ul>
    <p>If you’ve lost more than one pregnancy, you can apply for a separate certificate for each baby loss.</p>
   <p>Your certificate should arrive in the post within 14 days. If you do not receive it, you can request another certificate.</p>
   
   <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Get help to request a certificate</h2>
   <p>If you want your certificate in a different format or cannot request the certificate online, email or call the helpline.</p>
